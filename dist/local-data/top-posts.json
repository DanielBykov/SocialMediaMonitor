      "title": "We have THE BEST news for you this week ‚Äì Jamila has given birth to a healthy rhino calf!\n \nThis is a momentous occasion for all Aucklanders as it‚Äôs the first time in twenty years that a rhino calf has been born at Auckland Zoo, as well as an incredible win for the Australasian breeding programme. \n\nThis sturdy female calf, with a birth weight of around 65kgs, was born in the early hours of August 14th in a speedy one-hour labour. Rhino gestation lasts 16-months in total and faecal testing for progesterone levels provided a great indicator of when Jamila would give birth. With the support of Panasonic New Zealand, we were able to install and utilise low light security camera equipment that allowed our ungulates team to monitor Jamila‚Äôs pregnancy at all hours of the day ‚Äì both at the Zoo and from home. \n\nAs many of you will know, in late-2018 Jamila made the journey to Auckland from our friends at Hamilton Zoo and it was our hope that she would soon become a first-time mum. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long wait, but absolutely worth every second,‚Äù says ungulates team leader Tommy. ‚ÄúJamila‚Äôs total focus on her calf‚Äôs needs is really impressive. She‚Äôs growing by the day, and as she‚Äôs finding her feet, doing these little jumps, almost dancing, which is pretty adorable.‚Äù\n\nIt's early days so the calf and her mum have not yet ventured out into their African Savannah habitat and we‚Äôll keep you updated on when you‚Äôll be able to see them. See more photos and learn how you help us to support rhino conservation every time you visit the Zoo, here ‚Äì www.aucklandzoo.co.nz/news/auckland-zoos-new-baby-rhino-makes-speedy-entry-into-world\n \nStay tuned for another special announcement tomorrow!"
